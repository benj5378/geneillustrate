# GeneIllustrate

GeneIllustrate is a program for visualising small gene sequences - and in future possibly also larger genes, overview-visualisations, restriction sites, codons, etc.

We want to make it easy and effective to create illustrations for articles and teaching.

## How to get started?

1. Download the program and install Python, if you don't already have it installed (remember to check add to path!).
2. Open the terminal, `cd` into the folder with the program
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run `python main.py`
